/**
 * Handles some boilerplate around defining a simple jest/Jasmine test for a
 * jscodeshift transform.
 * @param  {String} dirName          contains the name of the directory the test is located in. This
 *                                   should normally be passed via __dirname.
 * @param  {String} transformName    contains the filename of the transform being tested,
 *                                   excluding the .js extension.
 * @param  {String} [testFilePrefix] Optionally contains the name of the file with the test
 *                                   data. If not specified, it defaults to the same value as `transformName`.
 *                                   This will be suffixed with ".input.js" for the input file and ".output.js"
 *                                   for the expected output. For example, if set to "foo", we will read the
 *                                   "foo.input.js" file, pass this to the transform, and expect its output to
 *                                   be equal to the contents of "foo.output.js".
 * @param  {any} transformObject     Object to be transformed with the transformations
 * @param  {String} action init, update or remove, decides how to format the AST
 * @return {Void} Jest makes sure to execute the globally defined functions
